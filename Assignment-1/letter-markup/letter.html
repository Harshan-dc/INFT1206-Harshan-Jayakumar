    year is noted, and I will address your questions in the following sections.
  </p>

  <!-- Section 1 -->

  <p>Please confirm your preferred semester start date.</p>

  <!-- Section 2 -->
  <h2>Proposed Research Topics</h2>

  <p>
    At our faculty, we encourage open-minded research in science and technology.
    Your proposals were intriguing, particularly:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      Transforming H<sub>2</sub>O into wine and analyzing health effects of
      Resveratrol (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>).
    </li>
    <li>
      Studying performance of funk bass players at >30°C (86°F), audience size
      growth: 3 × 10<sup>3</sup> to 3 × 10<sup>4</sup>.
    </li>
    <li>
      <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and
      <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> for digital musical
      scores representation.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    Please provide additional details on these projects, such as duration,
    team requirements, and resources needed.
  </p>

  <!-- Section 3 -->
  <h2>Exotic Dance Research</h2>

  <p>
    Regarding your question on tribal dances, I <em>did study</em> them during
    my post-doctorate. My favorites include:
  </p>

  <dl>
    <dt>Polynesian Chicken Dance</dt>
    <dd>
      A culturally influential dance from 300
      <abbr title="Before Common Era">BCE</abbr>, performed in circles to
      promote livestock fertility.
    </dd>
    <dt>Icelandic Brownian Shuffle</dt>
    <dd>
      Pre-fire, Icelanders practiced a floor circle shuffle with subtle,
      rapid movements. This may have inspired modern dance styles like
      Twerking.
    </dd>
    <dt>Arctic Robot Dance</dt>
    <dd>
      Misinterpreted by explorers in the 1960s as robotic movement, but
      actually a response to extreme cold conditions.
    </dd>
  </dl>

  <p>Yours faithfully,</p>

  <p>Dr. Eleanor Gaye</p>
